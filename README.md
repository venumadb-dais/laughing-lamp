# Responsive frontend with Routing and API Integration

## Objective
Create a response frontend with multiple components and routing functionality. The application reads parameters from the URL, fetches data from a public API, and displays content dynamically based on the parameters.

## Features

1. **Page Structure:**
   - Create at least three components (e.g., Home, User Profile, and About).
   - Implement routing between these pages using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

2. **URL Parameters:**
   - Read parameters from the URL to customize the content of the pages.
   - Example: On the User Profile page, display a welcome message that includes the user's name from the URL (e.g., `/profile?name=John` displays "Welcome, John!").

3. **API Integration:**
   - Use a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder, OpenWeather) to fetch data.
   - Display this data dynamically on one of the pages (e.g., fetch and display a list of posts on the Home page).

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the web application is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

## Optional Features

- **Nested Routing:**
  - Implement nested routing for more complex page structures (e.g., within the User Profile page, have sub-routes for viewing and editing user details).

- **Route Parameters:**
  - Use the framework's built-in route parameters to pass and read content (e.g., `/profile/:username` where `username` is a dynamic parameter).

## Technologies

- **JavaScript Framework**: React, Angular, or Vue.js
- **API Requests**: Fetch API or Axios or built-in methods in the framework
- **CSS**: Flexbox or Grid for responsive design
